# Installation
Either clone this repository or download it as zip, then put the `cba` folder into your `res://addons/` folder. If you don't have an `addons` folder, you can create it yourself.

# Usage
Simply go to `Project > Tools > Backgrounds`. That should open up the configuration window.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Changing the `UI color will temporarily freeze your editor. Don't worry, that's supposed to happen.
